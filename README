Fix 2Checkout Payment Option

1. Upload all the content inside the included 2Checkout_VirtueMart folder to the root where your joomla site is located on your hosting/server.

2. Go into your VirtueMart componet admin area , click List Payment Methods, activate and select 2Checkout, click configuration and fill out the required info. It is EXTREMELY IMPORTANT that you copy all of 2Checkout_Payment_Extra_Info.txt over what is entered in the Payment Extra Info section on this page, otherwise the payment method will not work.

Thats it, everything should work correctly now. Please contact 2Checkout directly with any integration questions.
